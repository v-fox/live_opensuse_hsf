This is hybrid live cd/usb openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling spin aimed to be fully functional out-of-the-box yet slim desktop system for hackers of all sorts: technical, humanitarian, artistic, social and so on. It's built on "one user-friendliest method for fulfilling every need" principle.  
It DOES NOT guarantee best security defaults, so users with sensitive needs are advised to direct their attention to something like [TAILS](https://tails.boum.org), [CAINE](https://www.caine-live.net) or [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org), however it should be quite adequate as an installation basis for everyday use and comes with pre-configured data proxying via [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html) & [I2P](https://geti2p.net) and [DNSCrypt](http://dnscrypt.org).

I recommend using smart SATA boxes and usb drives with legacy (floppy / CD / virtual partition) emulation as the replacement for disks, like:  
⊘ [IODD](https://iodd.co.kr) / [Zalman ZM-\*](https://www.zalman.com/global/product/CategorySecond_Pic.php) series  
⊘ [The IsoStick](https://isostick.com)  
⊘ or just using it on any fast USB stick  

It provides:

It does NOT provide:
--------------------
— whole KDE or Gnome (because of how fat the former and how ugly the later are)  
— accessibility features (because I have no idea how to setup them right)  
  but there is `onboard` virtual keyboard  
— security hardening (because it requires strict and thorough testing  
  in all usage scenarios which are manifold)  

Notes:
------
⊙  **the first thing you should do on freshly loaded system is to look at keepnote's HSF note**  
⊙ use `locate` to search for files fast and `apropos` to search for commands based on their manual's description  
⊙ Firefox and Thunderbird are set up to use Tor by default, *_proxy variables are also globally set, DNS queries are encrypted and funneled to OpenDNS by default  
⊙ popular Microsoft fonts are included for web & document compatibility. they may be removed in future  

⊙ can be put on flash USB sticks and such from within itself by  
* simple `dd bs=<your flash's write block size, like 64K> if=<image or even cdrom device that you have booted it on> of=/dev/<target_device>`,
* glamorous GUI tools like SUSE's `imagewriter` (included) or Ubuntu's `win32diskimager`
* (`unetbootin` is NOT recommended due to its outdatedness and broken device selection)
* but **be wary that it will format all redundant space as ext4 for its R/W support**
* you may need to disable "Secure Boot" DRM and enable "BIOS-compatibility mode" to boot via U/EFI

⊙ DE-specific apps are included for the lack of adequate analogues  
* KDE:  
  * krusader (dolphin + konqueror + mc in one package and more ? yes, please)  
  * yakuake (handy console), will be replaced with finalterm once it matures  
  * kate/kwrite (great simple editor)  
  * okular (useful doc viewer, integrated in Firefox via kparts-plugin)  
  * kchmviewer (MS chm viewer), because sometimes okular screws up  
  * gwenview5 + digikam5/showfoto (highly-capable image viewers)  
  * k3b (rich disk burner), because some people still are into this stuff)  
* GNOME:  
  * nm-applet (this is _the only_ NM GUI that can launch in any DE)  
  * blueman (bluez5 control)  
  * gparted (The F/OSS disk editor), even though it can be substituted with YaST  
  * pasystray (PulseAudio control) and all its dependencies  
  * easytag (The audio file tag editor)  
  * seahorse (gpg GUI)  
  * gcr-viewer (crypto file viewer)  

⊙ Some specialty apps that were not included but you may be interested in installing manually  
* music works  
  * ardour, rosegarden, qtractor, hydrogen, mixxx, rakarrack, OpenOctaveMidi, vmpk  
* video editing  
  * cinelerra, LiVES, openshot, avidemux, kino  
* 3D modeling  
  * blender

* OCR (image_of_text-to-real_text conversion)  
  * tesseract-{gui} / gocr{-gui} / orcad / ocropus (OCR systems)  
  * djvubind or ocrodjvu/img2djvu (DjVu-centric wrappers for OCR systems)  
* telephony  
  * sflphone-client-gnome (SIP client that natively supports JACK and has many features... and glitches)  
  * blink (supposedly is "the best real-time communications client using SIP protocol". ALSA-only and crash-prone)  
  * ekiga (simple but ALSA-only)  
  * yate-qt4 (lots of features with no GUI for them)  
  * jitsi (Jack-of-all-trades and JAVA-fatass)  
* multimedia  
  * SMplayer GUI for mpv & mplayer (allows extreme fine-tuning but is full of legacy code)  
  * VLC (the king of media players but it's interface sucks)  
  * QMPlay2 (vlc-like player with better GUI but without JACK support)  

Building:
---------
* ∀ every build comes with its building source in '/home/hacker/Hackeurs Sans Frontieres - build sources - ${VERSION_CONFIG}_${BUILD_DATE}.tar.xz'
* ∀ you can build your own image by:
 	1. using openSUSE
 	2. having "kiwi" and "kiwi-desc-isoboot" packages installed
 	3. editing files, starting from 'source/*' and 'create_appliance.sh'. or not
 	4. running `create_appliance.sh`
 	5. waiting quite a bit

* ∀ the process of development for this project is like this:
 	01. _future_ release version is set in 'config/version'
 	02. desired functional changes are made
 	03. package lists are sorted via `config/sort.sh`, gitignore is generated via `data/common-userfiles_1-generate-gitignore.sh` and then changes are committed
 	04. image is build via `create_appliance.sh`
 	05. image is booted on real hardware and tested, maybe also in virtual hardware
 	06. bugs and insufficiencies are noted/reported/filed
 	07. fixes made
 	08. new image is tested and steps 6-7-8 are repeated until condition is satisfactory
 	09. the image that deemed satisfactory is considered as current release, `git tag -a` is issued with "future", now current, version
 	10. everything is repeated
