Although a WebExtensions API is in the works, it is not available in Firefox 57. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do, other than hope that the API gets into Firefox 58.\n\nThis extension allows you to enter data into the Password Manager database instead of relying on Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, etc., to do it, as well as making changes to existing entries. For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description). Never use a review for this, as I have no real way of contacting you.

It will work in Firefox 52 ESR until ESR moves to Firefox 59 in 2018 (~Q2).\n\nWaterfox browser is based on Firefox and will keep legacy add-on support, so CTR will work even after Firefox 57 release.\n\nThere is no \"please port it\" or \"please add support for it\" this time. The entire add-on eco system changes and the technology behind this kind of add-ons gets dropped.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis add-on restores squared tabs, the application button with application menu (known from Firefox for Windows), the add-on bar, bookmarks/history menu/sidebar buttons and other buttons. It moves star & feed buttons into location bar, adds status bar element to the ui and allows many items to be movable. All features are fully optional. Some buttons have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customizing' mode.\n\nMain features (on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    Tab appearance: squared tabs (classic)\n    Tab appearance: curved tabs (all colored and visible)\n    Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false/true\"] attribute\n    Tab width and height settings\n    Tab title in Firefox titlebar\n    Tab loading animations\n    Tab close button on all tabs, active tab, toolbars start/end\n    Restore tabs empty favicon\n    Custom 'new tab' page url (Firefox 41+)\n    Double click on tabs toolbar opens 'new' tab [Windows only]\n    Hide tabs toolbar with one visible tab\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Custom tab separators\n    Application button on toolbars (+ icon variations)\n    Application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Custom title for application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Predefined/custom application button colors\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Movable back-forward buttons\n    Alternative appearance for preferences/options page\n    Open preferences/options page in a window (simulates preference window)\n    Alternative add-ons manager appearance (Firefox 40+)\n    Show add-ons version number inside add-ons manager (Firefox 40+)\n    Activity indicator (throbber) on toolbars\n    Bookmarks-star button in location bar\n    Rss-Feed button in location bar\n    Old Search UI (Firefox 43+)\n    Movable status-bar panel\n    Old location bar appearance (Firefox 48+)\n    Additional location bar\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Hide location bars stop, reload & go buttons\n    Hide private browsing mask\n    Findbar on top or bottom\n    'Icons & Text' and 'Text only' modes\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar node\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    Green/blue site identity button for verified websites and secure connections\n    Replace context menu icons with labels (Back, Forward...)\n    Add up to 20 additional toolbars to to top browsers area\n    Replace generic favicon with different icons\n    Favicon of a website in locations bars identity button\n    Different padlock icons for secure connections\n    AeroBlue toolbar colors for Windows 8/XP/Classic, Linux, MacOSX\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Inverted/white toolbar button icons\n    Predefined toolbar settings to alter colors, sizes, borders\n    Disable some of browsers default ui animations\n    Force some hidden toolbars to appear in fullscreen mode\n    Remove title/menu/tabs toolbars background color (Windows 10)\n    Disable browsers Loop (chat), Reader & Pocket features\n    ...and more\n\n\nFeatures (not on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    about:preferences keeps last selected category/tab\n    'Add-on Bar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle 'Add-on Bar' using 'Ctrl + /' btw.

On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer).\nProfile Switcher add-on and Profilist add-on can help creating new profiles.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to try

Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, facebook, etc.","fullDescription":"uMatrix: A point-and-click matrix-based firewall, with many privacy-enhancing tools.\n\n*For advanced users.*\n\nuMatrix put you in full control of where your browser is allowed to connect, what type of data it is allowed to download, and what it is allowed to execute. Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.

It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @

Report a fake location with the addition of random noise in order to protect your privacy. Per site settings with three configurable levels of accuracy or even the possibility to use a fixed location.","fullDescription":"Modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox can tell websites where you're located in order to provide location-aware functionality. Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"364","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"104","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"367","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"105","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Options page on Android."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/419849/location_guard-1.2.3-fx+an.xpi?src=api","size":295175,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":46,"totalDownloads":481605,"weeklyDownloads":891,"dailyUsers":16474,"updateDate":1459524460000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues"},{"id":"{e4a8a97b-f2ed-450b-b12d-ee082ba24781}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-32.png?modified=1507047621","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-64.png?modified=1507047621"},"name":"Greasemonkey","type":"extension","version":"3.17","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Anthony Lieuallen","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/arantius/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Aaron Boodman","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/aaron-boodman/?src=api"},{"name":"Johan Sundström","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/ecmanaut/?src=api"}],"description":"Customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.","fullDescription":"Allows you to customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.\n\nYou can write your own scripts, too.

The random selection can be set to include all profiles, desktop profiles only, mobile profiles only or a specific OS family only eg Random Windows Browsers only. There is a large list of profiles which are generally updated for each release. Note: a profile is much more than a simple user agent string\n    The interval at which the random profiles are chosen can be selected when a random option has been selected. The interval can also be random, a specific time period or per session if not set. Note: the time interval dropdown is only shown when it is relevant, so only when a random option is selected\n    Profiles can be excluded from random selection by selecting the checkbox beside the specific profile. Note: the checkboxes only appear when a random option is selected as that is only when they apply\n    The choice of profile and time interval if set in addition to other choices persist between browser restarts unlike other such addons\n    In addition to using the panel to select profiles the RAS context menu item can also be used.

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it.

It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and any Firefox forked versions (such as Palemoon, Cyberfox, Waterfox, etc.). It is not officially available for MAC, because I can't offer support for this platform in case of issues.\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nCONCERNS MULTIPROCESSING COMPATIBILITY WITH FIREFOX 54+\nAll complete themes do disable multiprocess mode. This means that it is not an issue specifically related to my theme. Any complete theme you can install will disable it.\nThis was a preventative measure applied by Mozilla to avoid any compatibility problems. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work around this, so users who want to use my theme will be stuck with single-process mode until the programmed end of complete themes (starting Firefox 57). Thanks for your understanding\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n• Before posting a review, please take the time to read first the review guidelines described here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/review_guide. Thank you.\n\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.
