We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\nWe are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\nPlease do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section, but file a bug report instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\nPlease note: Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll!

Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?modified=1543520594","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.png?modified=1543520594","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.

Report a fake location with the addition of random noise in order to protect your privacy. Per site settings with three configurable levels of accuracy or even the possibility to use a fixed location.","fullDescription":"Modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox can tell websites where you're located in order to provide location-aware functionality. Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?modified=1543520064","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?modified=1543520064","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?modified=1543520065","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?modified=1543520065","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?modified=1543520067","width":364,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?modified=1543520067","thumbnailWidth":333,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?modified=1543520068","width":367,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?modified=1543520068","thumbnailWidth":336,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Options page on Android."}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard","supportURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.8661,"reviewCount":77,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":2549,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3409092/location_guard-2.4.0-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1569023439000},{"id":"smart-referer@meh.paranoid.pk","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/327/327417-32.png?modified=f7d194b9","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/327/327417-64.png?modified=f7d194b9","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/327/327417-128.png?modified=f7d194b9"},"type":"extension","name":"Smart Referer","version":"0.2.15","creator":{"name":"meh.","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5453183/"},"developers":[{"name":"Alexander Schlarb","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5622055/"}],"description":"Improve your privacy by limiting Referer information leak!","fullDescription":"Automatically hide HTTP Referer and JavaScript document.referrer for cross-domain requests!\n\nTo workaround (rare) breakage, a whitelist of related domains is regularily downloaded (24h) and applied in the background.
